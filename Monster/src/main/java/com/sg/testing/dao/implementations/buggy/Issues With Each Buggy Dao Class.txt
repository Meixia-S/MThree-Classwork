BadMonsterDaoA:
- getMonster does not check if id exist before returning, so it returns null at times.

BadMonsterDaoB:
- removeMonster only retrieves the Monster with the given id and does not actually delete it.

BadMonsterDaoC:
- getAllMonsters traverses an empty list and tries to add its items to itself.
    (aka a completely logical mess)

BadMonsterDaoD:
- updateMonster puts a new entry into the map regardless if the id already existed in the map.

BadMonsterDaoE:
- getMonster removes a Monster from the map and returns it instead of just returning it.

BadMonsterDaoF:
- getAllMonsters adds each Monster two times and therefore returns a list twice the size it
should be.
